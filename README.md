<b>Technologies Used:</b>Written in Java. Main libraries used: JSON, Gson, and Mapboxsdk for the map view. 

<b>Status:</b>Work in Progress. 

<b>To Do:</b>
When zooming out in the map view, the icons cluster together. This needs to be adressed. Also, better icons could be used and ideally have the details of the establishment above each icon. 

<b>To Run:</b>
The project will run in Android Studio and tested to run on a Pixel 3@API28. Should work fine on any phone/virtual machine at API 28+.
